# GameJam2022

Inspired by an arcade classic featuring a dark and moody palette inspired by Sydney's atrocious weather.  

A simple game where you shoot knives by clicking on the screen. Make sure you do not hit two knives on the same spot or ELSE...
Hit power-ups to help you reach higher levels. Each level requires you to hit a certain number of knives on the target to proceed to the next level.  



This game only requires PyGame to be installed and can be run by using the command "python3 main.py"

The background music was downloaded from 'https://filmmusic.io', and sound effects were downlaoded from 'https://opengameart.org'
