Inspired by an arcade classic featuring a dark and moody palette inspired by Sydney's atrocious weather.  

A simple game where you shoot knives by clicking on the screen. Make sure you do not hit two knives on the same spot or ELSE...
Hit power-ups to help you reach higher levels. Each level requires you to hit a certain number of knives on the target to proceed to the next level.
